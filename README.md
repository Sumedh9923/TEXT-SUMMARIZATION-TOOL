## 📌 Overview
The **Text Summarization Tool** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based Python application designed to generate concise summaries from lengthy articles or paragraphs.  
In the modern digital world, massive amounts of textual data are generated daily in the form of news articles, blogs, academic papers, reports, and documentation. Reading full-length content can be time-consuming and inefficient. This tool solves that problem by automatically identifying the most important sentences in a text and producing a meaningful summary while preserving the original context.
This project implements **Extractive Text Summarization**, where key sentences are selected based on statistical importance rather than generating new sentences.

## 🎯 Task Objective
The objective of this project was to:
- Develop a Python-based tool to summarize long textual content.
- Apply Natural Language Processing techniques.
- Demonstrate sentence tokenization and word tokenization.
- Perform stopword removal and word frequency analysis.
- Generate concise summaries automatically.
- Showcase both input text and summarized output.

This project fulfills the requirement of building a functional NLP-based summarization system.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools Used

### 👨‍💻 Programming Language
- **Python 3.11.1**

### 📚 Libraries
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**  
  - Sentence Tokenization  
  - Word Tokenization  
  - Stopword Removal  
  - Text Processing  

- **Collections (defaultdict)**  
  - Efficient word frequency counting  

### 💻 Development Environment
- Windows Command Prompt
- VS Code / Notepad / Python IDLE
- Compatible with PyCharm & Jupyter Notebook

# ⚙️ How It Works
The tool follows a structured NLP pipeline:

1. **Input Text** – A long article or paragraph is provided.
2. **Sentence Tokenization** – The text is split into individual sentences.
3. **Word Tokenization** – Each sentence is broken into words.
4. **Stopword Removal** – Common words like *is, the, and* are removed.
5. **Word Frequency Calculation** – Important words are identified based on occurrence.
6. **Sentence Scoring** – Sentences are scored using word frequency.
7. **Sentence Ranking** – Highest scoring sentences are selected.
8. **Summary Generation** – Top sentences are combined into a concise summary.
This ensures the summary captures the most meaningful information.
